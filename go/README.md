# BoxPacker Go Implementation

This directory contains the Go implementation of the BoxPacker library, migrated from PHP.

## Directory Structure

```
go/
├── src/           # Go source code (will contain the actual implementation)
├── tests/         # Go test files migrated from PHP tests
├── go.mod         # Go module file
└── README.md      # This file
```

## Test Files

All PHP tests from the `tests/` directory have been migrated to Go. The structure is as follows:

### Helper/Support Files (test utilities)
- `testbox.go` - Test implementation of Box interface
- `testitem.go` - Test implementation of Item interface
- `limitedsupplytestbox.go` - Limited supply box for testing
- `thpacktestitem.go` - THPack test item with placement constraints
- `constrainedplacementbycounttestitem.go` - Item with count-based constraints
- `constrainedplacementnostackingtestitem.go` - Item with no-stacking constraints
- `packedboxbyreferencesorter.go` - Sorter for packed boxes by reference

### Test Files (migrated from PHP)
- `packeditem_test.go` - PackedItem tests
- `noboxesavailableexception_test.go` - Exception handling tests
- `workingvolume_test.go` - WorkingVolume tests
- `packedlayer_test.go` - PackedLayer tests
- `weightredistributor_test.go` - Weight redistribution tests (stubs)
- `volumepacker_test.go` - VolumePacker tests (stubs)
- `packedboxlist_test.go` - PackedBoxList tests
- `packedbox_test.go` - PackedBox tests
- `itemlist_test.go` - ItemList tests
- `orientateditem_test.go` - OrientatedItem tests
- `orientateditemfactory_test.go` - OrientatedItemFactory tests (stubs)
- `efficiency_test.go` - Efficiency tests (stubs)
- `packer_test.go` - Main Packer tests (stubs)
- `publishedtestcases_test.go` - Published test cases (stubs)
- `boxlist_test.go` - BoxList tests

## Test Migration Notes

1. **Data Providers**: PHP data providers have been converted to table-driven tests in Go using slices of test cases
2. **Assertions**: PHPUnit assertions have been converted to Go testing package assertions
3. **Stubs**: Some tests are marked with `t.Skip()` as they require the full Packer implementation which is not yet ported
4. **JSON Serialization**: MarshalJSON methods have been implemented to match PHP's JsonSerializable behavior

## Running Tests

```bash
cd go
go test ./tests/...
```

To run tests with verbose output:

```bash
cd go
go test -v ./tests/...
```

## Current Status

- ✅ Test structure migrated
- ✅ Helper classes implemented
- ✅ Basic tests passing
- ⏳ Full Packer implementation (in progress)
- ⏳ Integration tests (pending full implementation)

## Next Steps

1. Implement the core BoxPacker algorithm in `go/src/`
2. Update test stubs to use actual implementation
3. Verify all tests pass with real implementation
4. Add benchmarks for performance comparison
