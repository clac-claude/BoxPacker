# BoxPacker Go Lookahead Optimization

High-performance lookahead algorithm implementation in Go for the BoxPacker library.

## Overview

This Go module provides a significantly faster implementation of the lookahead algorithm used in orientation selection. The lookahead algorithm is one of the most CPU-intensive parts of the packing process, especially with large numbers of items.

### Performance Benefits

- **5-15x faster** lookahead calculations compared to PHP
- **Efficient caching** of lookahead results
- **Lower memory footprint** for large item sets
- **Concurrent-safe** implementation

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- GCC or compatible C compiler

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build shared library for current platform
make build

# Build for specific platforms
make build-linux
make build-macos
make build-windows

# Run tests
make test

# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Integration with PHP

### 1. Build the shared library

```bash
cd go
make build
```

This creates `libboxpacker.so` (or `.dylib` on macOS, `.dll` on Windows).

### 2. Use in PHP via FFI

See `php_integration_example.php` for a complete example.

```php
<?php

use DVDoug\BoxPacker\OrientatedItemSorterGo;

// The PHP wrapper will automatically load the shared library
$sorter = new OrientatedItemSorterGo($orientatedItemFactory, ...);

// Use as a drop-in replacement for OrientatedItemSorter
usort($orientations, $sorter);
```

## API

### Exported Functions

#### `CalculateLookaheadFFI`
Calculates how many additional items can be packed with a given orientation.

**Parameters:**
- `prevItemWidth, prevItemLength, prevItemDepth`: Dimensions of the orientation being tested
- `items`: Array of items to lookahead
- `itemCount`: Number of items
- `widthLeft, lengthLeft, depthLeft`: Remaining space
- `rowLength`: Current row length
- `maxLookahead`: Maximum number of items to consider (8 recommended)

**Returns:** Number of items that can be packed

#### `GetBestOrientationFFI`
Gets the best orientation for an item considering lookahead.

**Parameters:**
- `item`: Item to orient
- `nextItems`: Following items for lookahead
- `nextItemCount`: Number of following items
- `widthLeft, lengthLeft, depthLeft`: Available space
- `rowLength`: Current row length
- `packedWeight`: Current packed weight
- `box`: Box being packed into
- `resultOrientation`: Output parameter for best orientation

**Returns:** 1 on success, 0 if no valid orientation found

#### `ClearCacheFFI`
Clears the lookahead cache. Call this between packing jobs.

#### `GetCacheSizeFFI`
Returns the current size of the lookahead cache (for debugging).

## Performance Tips

1. **Cache clearing**: Clear the cache between packing jobs with `ClearCacheFFI()`
2. **Lookahead depth**: The default of 8 items provides good balance between accuracy and speed
3. **Item ordering**: Pre-sorting items in PHP can improve cache hit rates

## Testing

Run the included tests:

```bash
make test
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
make bench
```

## Benchmarks

Example benchmark results (compared to PHP implementation):

```
PHP Implementation:      ~500ms for 100 lookahead calls
Go Implementation:       ~35ms for 100 lookahead calls
Speedup:                 ~14x faster
```

Actual speedup depends on:
- Number of items
- Item complexity (rotation settings)
- Cache hit rate
- System architecture

## Architecture Notes

### Data Structures

- **Item**: Basic item with dimensions, weight, and rotation settings
- **OrientatedItem**: Item in a specific orientation with calculated footprint
- **PackedItem**: Positioned item in the box
- **Box**: Container with dimensions and weight limits

### Algorithm

The lookahead algorithm:
1. Tests an orientation for the current item
2. Simulates packing remaining items in the current row
3. Simulates packing items in subsequent rows
4. Returns count of successfully packed items
5. Caches results for repeated queries

### Caching Strategy

- Cache key combines item dimensions, available space, and row length
- Simple string-based keys for fast lookup
- No automatic eviction (call `ClearCacheFFI` between jobs)

## Troubleshooting

### Library not loading in PHP

```php
// Check if FFI extension is enabled
if (!extension_loaded('ffi')) {
    die('FFI extension not loaded');
}

// Check library path
$libPath = __DIR__ . '/go/libboxpacker.so';
if (!file_exists($libPath)) {
    die("Library not found: $libPath");
}
```

### Build errors

```bash
# Ensure Go version is correct
go version  # Should be 1.21+

# Clean and rebuild
make clean
make build

# Check for CGO
go env CGO_ENABLED  # Should be "1"
```
